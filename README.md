# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions in D for this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

### Usage:

You need the official D compiler `dmd` and `make`.
Then you can compile and run each day with the script `run`, e.g. with

    ./run day25

### Downloading data

I use the following script to automatically downloading the input data from the website.
It requires a virtual environment for Python in the `.venv` directory, and the [advent-of-code-data](https://pypi.org/project/advent-of-code-data/) package.

    ./getdata
